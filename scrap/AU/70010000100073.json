  "description": "Cronos: The New Dawn is a brutal third-person survival horror where you fight for the future by salvaging the past. Burn monsters before they merge. Extract souls from the living. Adapt or die.\n\nSURVIVE THE FUTURE. SALVAGE THE PAST\nSet in a grim world where Eastern European brutalism meets retro-futurist technology, Cronos: The New Dawn lets you experience a gripping story that straddles the line between past and future.\nIn the past, you will witness a world in the throes of The Change, a cataclysmic event that forever altered humanity. Meanwhile, in the ravaged wastelands of the future, every moment is a fight for survival against dangerous abominations that will test both your reflexes and your tactical thinking.\nYou are a Traveler working for the enigmatic Collective, tasked with scouring the wastelands of the future in search of time rifts that will transport you to 1980s-era Poland.\n\nADAPT OR PERISH\nIn a desolate world filled with ever-present danger, your survival hinges on your ability to strategize and plan ahead. The enemies you’ll encounter are nightmarish creatures, born from the remnants of humanity – defeating them will require you to make full use of your arsenal. \nYou can manipulate temporal Anomalies to clear a path through the desolate environment, and will have to scavenge for resources to replenish your limited ammo and supplies. Good preparation is key. Once in battle, split-second decisions can mean the difference between life and death.\n\nDON’T LET THEM MERGE\nThe creatures you kill won’t stay dead for long. Fallen enemies can be absorbed by others — through a grotesque process called Merging — to become faster, tougher, and far deadlier.\nThe only way to stop them? Burn their bodies. And do it fast.\nIf you don’t, you’ll face ever-evolving abominations that will push your combat skills to their limits.\n\nHARVESTER OF SOULS\nYour mission is to locate key people from the past who perished in the ensuing apocalypse. Using your all-powerful Harvester, you can extract their Essences and have them accompany you into the future.\nBut be wary: these essences have a profound impact on your journey.\nThe more you carry, the more haunted your suit becomes — increasing your prowess on the battlefield but also bringing with them whispers in your ear and flickers into your vision, edging you ever closer to madness.",
