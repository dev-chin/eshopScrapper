  "description": "In this simulation game you work as a psychiatrist and try to help your clients solve their mental problems. However, this process is not just about conversations; each client has his/her own story, secrets and deep wounds waiting to be opened to you.\nEach client can meet with you for a maximum of 5 sessions. However, your scoring at the end of each session determines whether that client will come to the next session or not. Correct orientations and careful approaches ensure that the sessions continue and the client enters the healing process.\nEvery answer you give is important. \nThe dialogues you choose during the session will directly affect the emotional state of your client and the treatment process. A wrong word or an indifferent approach can shake your client's trust in you and negatively affect the process.\nBasic Gameplay Mechanics:\nClient Sessions: You can have a maximum of 5 sessions with each client. If you get enough points at the end of the session, the client agrees to come to the next session. Otherwise, he/she may leave the process halfway through.\nDialogue Based Progress: The answers and directions you give will shape both the course of the session and the overall story of the game. Your choices may increase or damage the clients' trust in you.\nMedication Recommendations: At the end of the session, you may have the right to recommend medication to your client in certain situations. Correct medication recommendation can earn extra points and speed up the client's healing process.\nHidden Stories: If you are careful and patient, you can reveal deep secrets that some clients hide. Secret stories both bring new perspectives to the session process and unlock private dialogues.\nPsychological Health System: You will also need to protect your own mental health. Difficult cases, negative session results or intense stress can affect your psychological health. Your success in the game will be determined not only by the recovery of your clients, but also by keeping your own mental health in balance.\nSession Records and Reports: At the end of each session, all conversations for the session are recorded. You can look at the relevant reports later.\nConsequences of Decisions:\nA wrong question can drive the client away.\nCorrect determinations can open the door to hidden stories.\nThe drug recommendation you give to save one client may be dangerous for another client.\nNeglecting your own mental health may cause the game to end.\nEach Client is a Story:\nEach client you will encounter in the game has a unique history. Discovering their traumas, anxieties, happiness and fears depends entirely on your skill. While some clients hide their past traumas, others may be skilfully hiding the truth among their stories. \nEmpathising, being a good listener and asking the right question at the right time will be your most powerful weapon in this game.\nHighlights:\nDialogue and decision-based gameplay \n5-session client processes \nThe unique story and hidden histories of each client \nContributing to the therapy process with medication recommendations \nSystem to keep your own psychological health in balance \nSession records and reporting system\nA Psychiatrist's Decisions Are Not Easy...\nTherapist Simulator takes you on a journey deep into the human mind. \nWill you be able to gain the trust of your clients? \nCan you uncover hidden stories? \nWill you be able to maintain your career while protecting your own psychological health?\nIn this journey between minds, your most important tool: Your words.",
