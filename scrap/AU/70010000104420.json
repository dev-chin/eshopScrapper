Trade with other factions or go to war for system-wide domination! Plan your strategy wisely and stay focused: you may encounter surprising stuff...\n\nCREATE YOUR OWN GAME\nThe Mastermine Edition offers you the ability to create your own universe. You can personalize the sun’s type, the number of planets and factions, the distance of your first planet to the sun, and the global size of your world. You can also add rules like a specific game mode, or a limited number of cycles. So much power is in your hands!\n\nREPRODUCE AND SHARE YOUR GAME\nWith great power comes great responsibility, so now that you can control the universe, it means that you can create the best strategy challenges! And the best part is that now, you can share any game with your friends. Each generated star system has a unique seed that allows it to be identically recreated on another profile. So, you can simply share the Game ID with anyone and play the exact same game. Dare to defy your friends with completely ridiculous or very complex systems, and explore infinite game strategies together!",
