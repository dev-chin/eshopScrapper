  "description": "You’ve just inherited a small supermarket and a modest amount of cash.\nNow it’s up to you to turn it into a thriving business empire. Manage operations, expand strategically, and earn your first million — and make your family proud.\n\nFeatures:\n• Explore & Learn: Walk around your store, order new stock, organize shelves, set prices, and operate cashier machines and terminals to handle payments.\n• Customer Satisfaction: Serve customers quickly to earn likes and boost your store’s reputation. Poor service leads to negative reviews and lower ratings.\n• Expand Your Store: Purchase nearby spaces to grow your supermarket. Larger stores mean higher utility costs such as electricity, water, and waste disposal.\n• Diversify Your Product Catalogue: Unlock new product categories, from dairy to household supplies, by acquiring licenses and attracting different types of shoppers.\n• Smart Pricing Strategy: Optimize prices to maximize profits.\n• Recycle for Rewards: Collect and recycle empty boxes to earn bonus cash — and help the planet.\n• Global Competition: Climb the worldwide leaderboard and become the ultimate Supermart Tycoon.\n• Stay Energized: Boost your energy each morning by eating well. Negative customer feedback affects your morale and energy levels.\n\nSell smart. Grow fast. Keep customers happy.\nThe road to becoming the world’s top Supermart entrepreneur starts here.\n\nHow to play ? \n1. Order Stocks : Order new stock from your in-game computer. Unpack deliveries and place products neatly on shelves, in fridges, and freezers.\n2. Open for business : Open your shop each morning. Customers will visit to buy what they need. Run marketing promotions to attract more visitors. At the end of the day, close the shop to review your earnings summary.\n3. Work as the cashier—scan items, process card payments, and make sure every customer leaves happy with their shopping and checkout experience.\n4. Pricing : Set and adjust prices to find the best balance between customer satisfaction and profit margins.\n5. Planning : Earn profits, reinvest wisely, and expand your store. Upgrade interiors, enlarge your space, and obtain distributor licenses to unlock a wider range of products. Keep adapting to changing retail trends.\n6. Personalise : Make your shop your own—customize floors, paint walls, and choose a name that defines your business.\n\n\nNote : You start with one shelve, computer and cash register, and small empty shop. Video shown is the mid/end game player, who have unlocked all the items. \n",
