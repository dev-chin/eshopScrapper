  "description": "Sun, beach and sea - sunken pirate treasures, mystical Mayan rites, a bubbling volcano - and lots of puzzles and lovable characters make for the vacation of a lifetime!\n\nA small village deep in the Central American jungle is in need of our intrepid vacationer's help. His experience in finding missing pussycats could prove invaluable! After all, Santo Toma's sacred relic - a golden cat - has been shattered by lightning and Scott is racing against time to find its golden twin. Time that the village, now plagued by misfortune and failed harvests, barely has.\n\nVisit all kinds of varied locations peppered with secrets. Meet interesting and multi-layered characters, complete challenging tasks and witness an exciting, tongue-in-cheek story about exotic monster fleas, sunken Mayan ruins and the question of how long you can hold your breath under water.\n\nAround 50 lovingly drawn, high-resolution locations ensure a colourful and varied journey. Dive down to sunken pirate ships, explore the claustrophobic cave system of an active volcano and admire the beauty of a long-forgotten, ancient Mayan village.\n\nScott Whiskers: the Search for the Golden Cat is a classic point & click adventure game - but with an audiovisual update. As a fan of the classics of the genre, you will have just as much fun as a genre newcomer with a penchant for exciting stories.\n\nIn detail:\n- The next big adventure from our missing cat specialist: Scott Whiskers\n- Dozens of colourful, high-resolution HD backgrounds\n- Lots of likeable characters, all with their own worries and desires\n- Many, many challenging puzzles, always solvable with logical and “around the corner” thinking\n- Subtitles and professional voice-over in English and German\n- Hotspot display\n- In-game journal\n- Numerous unlockable achievements",
