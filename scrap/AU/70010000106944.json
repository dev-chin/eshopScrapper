  "description": "\"MIDNIGHT LANDING\" is a flight simulation game released by TAITO in 1987.\nYou take control of an aircraft soaring through the midnight sky, with the goal of landing safely at the airport.\nThe lights of the runway come into view, signalling the end of your journey through the night.\nBring it to a perfect close with a beautiful landing.\n\nThe “Arcade Archives”series is developed with the concept of faithfully reproducing classic arcade games. It also includes convenient features such as difficulty and screen settings, rewind, rapid-fire, and multiple save slots. In addition, players can compete for the best scores with players around the world through online rankings.\n“Arcade Archives 2” adds a new “TIME ATTACK MODE” to the lineup of “ORIGINAL MODE,” “HI SCORE MODE,” and “CARAVAN MODE” included in the Arcade Archives series. In “TIME ATTACK MODE,” players compete to clear the game as quickly as possible, regardless of the score achieved. VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) support has also been added, allowing gameplay to be reproduced even closer to the original arcade experience.\nPlease enjoy these iconic arcade games that defined an era with the “Arcade Archives” series!\n\n*The options menu and manual are available in Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.",
