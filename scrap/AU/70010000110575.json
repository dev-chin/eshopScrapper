  "description": "Layers of Fear is the definitive edition of the award-winning first-person psychological horror series. Built on Unreal Engine 5, it combines Layers of Fear, Layers of Fear 2, and all released DLC, along with new chapters that tie every story together into a seamless, nightmarish whole. \n\nFace the madness. Finish the story. \n\nIncluded in this package: \n\nLayers of Fear - Venture through a sprawling, ever-shifting Victorian mansion as The Painter - an artist consumed with finishing his magnum opus. Search for the tools and memories needed to complete your masterpiece while reality bends and decays all around you. \n\nInheritance DLC - Return to the mansion as The Painter’s Daughter and confront the emotional scars your father left behind. Explore childhood recollections twisted by fear and guilt, revealing a haunting legacy of love, artistry, and madness passed down through generations. \n\nThe Final Note DLC - Experience the collapse of the family from The Painter’s Wife point of view. Uncover the hidden truths behind the tragedy and learn how devotion, resentment, and sacrifice reshaped the story you thought you knew. \n\nLayers of Fear 2 - Enter the spotlight as The Actor venturing aboard a mysterious ocean liner to take on the role of a lifetime. Receive guidance from an unseen director (voiced by Tony Todd), whose intense methods blur the line between reality and performance. \n\nThe Final Prologue - Step behind the camera as The Director to try and rescue a doomed production. Guide the cast and crew, confront your fears, and pay the price for your ambition as the set gradually succumbs to chaos and despair. \n\nThe Lighthouse Chapter - Assume the role of The Writer, seeking to tie every chapter of the series into one final narrative. Explore an abandoned lighthouse that conceals the truth behind each story and piece together the thread connecting them all. \n\nGame Features: \n\n- Immersive first-person gameplay that blends story-driven exploration, environmental puzzles, and psychological horror. \n- The interwoven stories of three creators - The Painter, The Actor, and The Writer - each consumed by their craft and willing to pay the ultimate price for it. \n- Rebuilt visuals with HDR, and dynamic lighting that deepen atmosphere, enhance realism, and make every flicker of light feel alive. \n- A haunting original soundtrack by award-winning composer Arek Reikowski, weaving fragile beauty, emotion, and unease into every scene.",
