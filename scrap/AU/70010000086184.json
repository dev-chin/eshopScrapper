  "description": "Put your engineering skills, intuition and smarts to test in this brand new Bridge Construction Simulator puzzle game. You will become a constructor who is required to improvise and – most of all – adapt to the task at hand. Use your resources to construct structures able to hold the weight of a car. Try to become a good builder as fast as you can - things will get hard. You won't be racing against the time, so be a careful and thoughtful constructor.\n\nYou will design and construct increasingly elaborate bridges across four varied locations. Each one is a different logic puzzle for a thoughtful builder. Things may seem easy when you start out in a city, but once you move to the canyon, valley and finally mountains it will get hard. The task is never impossible, but the size and resilience of your structures will have to increase substantially if you don't want to be responsible for a car crash. Use your logic and skill to become a master bridge builder and break some records along the way!\n\nIn addition to the normal mode Bridge Construction Simulator offers an easy (for an increased budget and more flexibility) or hard one (for an ultimate, seemingly impossible puzzle challenge that will be able to break even the best builder). There is something for a constructor of every skill level. If you find yourself in a tight spot, a hint system will help guide you to the solution and help you build your skill as a builder. Use the help provided to construct bridges that will not break.\n\nThe game is a simulator that makes extensive use of realistic physics. As the car drives through the construction you've built you will see it stretch and bend. That way even if you fail you can see the weak points of your construction and use your logic to improve it. Build with your brain and you will be good.\n\nRealistic and detailed graphics make every level of Bridge Construction Simulator come to life and even offer a slight consolation when you fail as a constructor. Because when your bridge collapses and the car falls down, you can at least expect a spectacular crash! Just enjoy it and don't let it break you - muster your skill and try again! Nothing is ever impossible for an ambitious constructor. Play and become a legendary bridge builder!\n\nGame features:\n- Superb physics - a true simulator\n- Multiple addictive levels across four different worlds\n- State of the art realistic graphics\n- Fantastic, varied and detailed environments - you won't get bored as you build\n- Spectacular special effects\n- Mind bending, challenging puzzles requiring the use of thought and logic\n- Varying skill levels for increased challenge or more relaxed gameplay - something for every constructor\n- Built-in hint system helps you build your skill",
