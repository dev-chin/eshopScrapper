  "description": "Sir Solomon and the Saviors of Light depart Castle Cornelius to free Princess Tsuna from the grasp of the evil Devil Lord!\n\nBut the knight is worried... What if after being freed, the princess falls in love with one of his friends instead of with him?\n\nSo he does what anyone would do when blinded by love, and ditches his friends!\n\nSolomon ventures into the Devil Lord's castle alone, vowing to steal the princess's heart.\n\nLABS and Matt Kap present Lovish, an outrageous 8-bit-styled action-adventure game! Venture through a series of bite-sized rooms, slicing up monsters, collecting items and getting to the exit! After exiting each room, enjoy a short event scene, in which anything could happen! Will you find an item? A random encounter RPG fight? Will the world get destroyed? Find out by conquering each room of the Devil Lord's castle, one challenge at a time!\n\nFeatures:\n\n- 50+ fun levels to play through, each with multiple objectives!\n- Wacky randomized event scenes between levels with hundreds of outcomes! You never know what you're gonna see next!\n- Collect a variety of items to upgrade Solomon's abilities, or expand the game in meaningful (and unmeaningful) ways!\n- Spend your pennies (in-game currency to be clear, no microtransactions here) in the in-game shop!\n- 100+ characters, some of which were designed by world-famous manga artist Ryusuke Mita (Dragon Half)\n- An exciting, 20+ tune soundtrack by Matt Kap (Castle In The Darkness, Astalon: Tears of the Earth)\n- Beautiful human-artist-made pixel art! Even the in-game AI art is drawn by a human person!\n- More secrets than ever before! (But this is the first game in this series, so that doesn't mean much, I guess.)\n- Unexpected guest characters\n- And lots more!\n\nSo please, be a good friend, and help Solomon rescue the princess!",
