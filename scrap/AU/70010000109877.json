  "description": "WHAT IS REANIMAL?\nThe original creators of Little Nightmares™ & Little Nightmares™ II have returned to take you on a more terrifying journey than ever before. In this co-op horror adventure game, you play as a brother & sister who go through hell to rescue their missing friends. Exploring by boat and on land, you must use your wits to survive, work together to escape the hellish island, and the dark secret that haunts you. \n\nHORROR WITH HOPE\nIn this unsettling tale, the emphasis is on tension and thick atmosphere, as you join the two orphans on a desperate search for hope and redemption in the direst of circumstances. \n\nACROSS A DARK AND TWISTED WORLD\nTraverse an intriguing but terrifying world, where the main path is only one part of the fragmented story. Discover all sorts of mysterious locations on your perilous journey, each with its own story to tell. \n\nA DREAD-FILLED ADVENTURE\nTarsier Studios is bringing their unique visual style to bear on a whole host of new twisted monsters and broken, yet resilient, child characters. Fragments of the children's troubled past have been used as inspiration for their character design, and for the monsters that now torment them. \n\nSHARE THE SCARE\nNobody should be forced to go through hell alone! Fully playable in single player and local & online co-op, REANIMAL has a shared, directed camera, designed to maximise claustrophobia and tension. ",
