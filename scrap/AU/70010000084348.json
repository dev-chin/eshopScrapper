(A separate Joy-Con (R) is required to play with one hand.)\n\nStory\nOne day as summer vacation draws near, our protagonist, Kanzaki Shuuichi, ends up watching a cursed Blu-ray handed to him by a mischievous friend. This results in Shuuichi getting possessed by a vindictive female spirit. The vindictive spirit's influence causes a rash of bizarre behavior from him, which worries his childhood friend Sairenji Murasaki, the daughter of a family-run temple. She exorcises the vindictive spirit...and as it disappears, a girl is left in its wake.\n\nThe girl introduces herself as Mikanagi Chiyako, and reveals that there are six more ghosts residing within her, for a total of seven girls whose ghosts still linger in the mortal world because of the strong emotions they felt at the time of their passing—and all of them are stuck in the same body.\n\nAccording to Murasaki, ghosts can only exist in this world for 49 days, which means there are only 7 days for each girl. To ensure that the girls can go to heaven happily, their lingering desires in this world must be fulfilled in this short amount of time—a task entrusted to Shuuichi.\n\nAnd so a quiet summer for Shuuichi and the seven girls, begins...\n\nStaff\nScenario: Major Tom\nOriginal Artwork: Miko\n\nCast\nMikanagi Chiyako    VA: Uesaka Sumire\nKutsuna Sakura    VA: Kiritani Choucho\nTsukinoki Kotoha    VA: Aranami Kazusa\nTakanashi Mari    VA: Fujita Masayo\nDoumeki Ichiru    VA: Shimizu Ayaka\nTsukumo Shizuku    VA: Toda Megumi\nShikima Nene    VA: Shimizu Ai\nSairenji Murasaki    VA: Ohashi Ayuru\n*Fully voiced (excluding the protagonist)\n",
