  "description": "\"BOMB JACK TWIN\" is an action game released by NMK(Original work by KOEI TECMO GAMES)  in 1993.\nThe popular \"BOMB JACK\" is back, cuter and tougher than ever! Two-player simultaneous play is also possible! \nDodge enemy attacks and collect all the bombs on the stage. Prioritize grabbing the lit bombs for a chance at a high score!\n\nThe “Arcade Archives”series is developed with the concept of faithfully reproducing classic arcade games. It also includes convenient features such as difficulty and screen settings, rewind, rapid-fire, and multiple save slots. In addition, players can compete for the best scores with players around the world through online rankings.\n“Arcade Archives 2” adds a new “TIME ATTACK MODE” to the lineup of “ORIGINAL MODE,” “HI SCORE MODE,” and “CARAVAN MODE” included in the Arcade Archives series. In “TIME ATTACK MODE,” players compete to clear the game as quickly as possible, regardless of the score achieved. VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) support has also been added, allowing gameplay to be reproduced even closer to the original arcade experience.\nPlease enjoy these iconic arcade games that defined an era with the “Arcade Archives” series!\n\nAt the time, the game was sold and distributed through NMK (current copyright successor: HAMSTER Corporation), which is why the in-game copyright notice displays NMK. However, the copyright of the game itself belongs to KOEI TECMO GAMES.\n\n*The options menu and manual are available in Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.",
