Take those to the Exchange Center to level up.\nAs your level increases, you will earn more money when squatting.\nSo keep squatting, buy various products, and raise your level even higher!\n\n- The Lottery System\nThe lottery ticket you get by squatting has six numbers from 1 to 35.\nThe winning numbers are drawn the next day.\nIf your ticket matches the result, you'll win some money!\nCheck your ticket the next day—and don’t forget to squat again to get your next chance!\n\n- Missions\nTake on two types of missions: daily and long-term.\nClear missions to earn money and stay motivated!\nDaily missions reset every day, so come back and complete them regularly.\nMake squatting a daily habit by crushing those missions!\n\n- Recording function\nYou can record how many squats you have done by day, month, and year, and look back on them at any time.\nDaily data can be recorded for up to 1000 days, monthly data for up to 120 months, and yearly data for up to 100 years.\n\nIn addition, the total amount of squats, total number of times, total time, total money earned, and total money spent are also recorded, so you can check your activity at any time.\n\n- Is this game for you?\nThis game is perfect for anyone who:\n\"Feels they’re not exercising enough compared to how much they eat\"\n\"Wants to sleep better by adding a bit of movement to their routine\"\n\"Knows squats are great but can’t seem to get started\"\n\"Wants to improve their health but struggles to find the time or motivation\"\n\n- Play style\nPlace the Joy-Con™ (L) on the leg strap and wear it on your thigh, and hold the Joy-Con™ (R) in your right hand to play.",
