  "description": "\"AIR COMBAT 22\" is a flight shooter released by NAMCO (Bandai Namco Entertainment) in 1995.\nThis title features an evolutionary step in 3D graphics and flashy animations using the \"Super System 22\" arcade board, an upgrade of the \"System 22\" architecture used for a wide range of legendary 3D games.\nTake on missions for the thrill of shooting down lots of enemy crafts, white-knuckle missions that require expert techniques, and more as you conquer diverse aerial combat scenarios. Become a hero of the skies!\n\n　In addition to the “ORIGINAL MODE,” “HIGH SCORE MODE,” and “CARAVAN MODE” included in the “Arcade Archives” series, “Arcade Archives 2” series will add new features such as “TIME ATTACK MODE” and “NETWORK MODE.”In “TIME ATTACK MODE” you compete to see who can beat the final boss the fastest stating from the first battle. This mode focuses on how quickly you can complete the game, regardless of the score you achieve. In “NETWORK MODE” you can play against other users over the network. However, “TIME ATTACK MODE” and “NETWORK MODE” may not be implemented in some games. “NETWORK MODE” will not be implemented for single-player games.\nAdditionally, functionality has been significantly enhanced. Multiple save slots have been implemented instead of just one, along with a rewind feature that allows players to retry gameplay and a quick start feature for those who want to dive straight into the game. Furthermore, VRR support has been added, enabling more accurate reproduction of the original arcade game's experience.\n　Enjoy the legendary arcade masterpiece with “Arcade Archives 2,” now more fun and user-friendly.\n\n*The options menu and manual are available in Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.\n\n*This title requires a maximum of 1 GB of download capacity, regardless of the \"Required Capacity\" below.",
