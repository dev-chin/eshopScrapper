  "description": "Welcome to ChromaTec, the universe’s leading producer of the ChromaGun (patent pending)! Here at ChromaTec, colors are magnets! Well, not exactly. Magnetoid Chromatism—a physical property of the pandimensional realm—is a bit more complex than that. In layperson’s terms: Walls attract objects of the same color. All kinds of objects! Like large boxes. Or small boxes. Or medium boxes! Or super-safe, friendly, decidedly non-murderous WorkerDroids*. (List not exhaustive)\n\nUse your refined painting and color-mixing skills to voluntarily solve intricate puzzles on the ChromaTec Testing Track for ChromaGun Research Purposes, Mark II — aka ChromaGun 2.\n\nPlease note the following are not valid reasons for non-participation:\n- Not having participated in the Testing Track Mark I\n    (aka ChromaGun 1; no prior knowledge necessary)\n- Color-blindness\n    (A color-blind accessibility mode is available at no extra charge) \n- Fear of birds**\n- Fear of magnets (They’re colors, not magnets)\n- Fear of being involuntarily forced to perform tests on an experimental color-based firearm (this will never happen)\n\nChromaTec would like to remind you of the following important disclaimer:\nNot solving tests as instructed is not advised.\nBreaking the ChromaGun is not advised.\nActivating a portal to a parallALTERNATEel uniREALITYverse is not ADVISEDadvised...\n\nChromaLABS would like to remind you of the following disclaimer:\nChromaLabs is the universe’s foremost—and only—manufacturer of the patented ChromaGun.
