  "description": "Engage in multiple game modes and arenas that remix the core rules and keep every match exciting to play and watch.\n\nLooking for a light‑hearted competitive game for your next game night? GRAVIATORS is a great pick for couch play with friends.\n\nPlay competitively in 1v1 or 2v2 matches, or team up in the cooperative Meteor Shower high‑score mode.\n\nFeatures\n• 1–4 Players (1v1, 2v2, CO‑OP 1–2 Players)\n• Local 1–4 Player (shared screen)\n• Online Multiplayer\n• 3 Game Modes (Classic Arena, Planetary Arena, Meteor Shower)\n• Full controller support\n• AI opponents available in competitive modes\n\nGRAVIATORS features simple controls while offering a deep skill curve for players who enjoy mastering movement, timing, and tactical play. The physics‑based controls are easy to learn in the step-by-step tutorial. Coordinating your abilities in real-time competition takes practice, but with three levels of AI opponents available, you can set the challenge to your comfort level and feel increasingly rewarded as your skills grow.\n\nNavigate your spacepod with directional input and use three abilities to control the ball and outmaneuver opponents:\n\n• Gravity – Pull the ball into orbit around your spacepod\n• Shield – Push nearby objects away\n• Boost – Dash quickly across the arena\n\nUse these tools to position yourself, take control of the ball, and fire it into the enemy goal.\n\nGAME MODES\n\nCLASSIC ARENA\nPlayers: 2–4\nThe core competitive mode of GRAVIATORS. Two teams (1v1 or 2v2) battle across a full‑field arena inspired by fast‑paced sports play. Each team’s goal sits in a corner and is protected by five shield segments arranged in a pentagon around the goal circle.\n\nHit shield pieces with the ball to break them and open a scoring path. A goal is worth 1 point for each missing shield when the ball enters the goal. Behind each goal is a return tunnel that shunts the ball back into center field, keeping the action moving.\n\nPLANETARY ARENA\nPlayers: 2–4\nA strategic twist on the base rules. Teams defend their entire side of the screen as their goal, with five shield segments arranged vertically to block incoming shots. A black hole and no‑cross barrier divide the arena, keeping each team on its own side.\n\nShoot the ball near or through the central black hole to bend its path and dramatically increase its speed, creating high‑risk, high‑reward plays.\n\nMETEOR SHOWER\nPlayers: 1–2 CO‑OP\nGo solo or team up with a friend to climb the online leaderboard. Defend your shared goal using five shield segments arranged along the bottom of the screen. Two balls are active at all times, and you must shoot them into falling meteors and enemy objects descending from above. Destroy enemy objects in quick succession to build up your score multiplier.\n\nIf an enemy hits a shield, that shield is destroyed. If an enemy slips through a gap into the goal area, the run ends. Survive as long as possible, build your multiplier, and push for a new high score.",
