  "description": "Majogami stars Shiroha, a young woman who has lost her memory, who travels alongside Shiori, her father who has been turned to paper. With her katana, \"Kamikiri\", in hand, she travels through a bizarre world and cuts through the horrors she finds there in this 2D character action platformer.\nPlayers take control of Shiroha who can move and attack instantly with her \"Setsuna\" ability, taking out enemies without missing a beat.\nAlong her journey, Shiroha will collect cards imbued with her memories called Recarte, and face off against the diverse Majogami, divine \"Craft Witches\" who control the world.\nThese Majogami, with twisted hearts and powerful magic, stand in Shiroha's way as she tries to escape their domain. In addition to her Setsuna attack, she can rely on Shiori's defense sigils and the power of the guardians she meets, the Astrals, to transform herself into new fighting forms.  \n\nBy defeating these Majogami, Shiroha can slowly regain her memories of both her and Shiori's life, deepening their bonds and revealing her story.\nExperience the touching family story and see Shiroha's determination to make it through this twisted world to the end.\n\n■Nintendo Switch™ 2 features\nMajogami for Nintendo Switch™ 2 features the option between 4k resolution display or 120 FPS gameplay, as well as enhancements to the overall image to best experience the beautiful and high-speed action.\n\n■Experience a strange and unique world!\nIn a brand new setting created by INTI CREATES art director Yuji Natsume*, Majogami combines paper craft and dark visuals in the world, characters, and game design.\nBe immersed in the lush setting and artwork as you delve into the action gameplay.\n\n■\"Setsuna\" brings unprecedented speed and freedom to combat!\nUse Setsuna to dive fearlessly at powerful enemies to slice them up quickly!\nWith a single button press, summon a unique Japanese-inspired effect as you slice your foe in two.\nNot only a mere attack, Setsuna will allow you move to areas you wouldn't otherwise, as well as allow you to dodge attacks when timed correctly.\nMaster Setsuna, and you'll experience satisfying combat like no other.\n\n■\"Astralize\" with the power of song!\nWith the energy you charge using Setsuna, you'll be able to transform Shiroha by borrowing the power of the gods known as Astrals.\nA lush animation accompanies these powerful transformations as Shiroha powers up.\nWhen she \"Astralizes\", Shiroha can weave a song together with the Astral to summon her ultimate ability, the Celestial Serenade.\nIts overwhelming power can send her cleaving through even the world itself, becoming a crucial tool in your arsenal.\n\n■A rich story with a colorful cast\nThe Majogami standing in your way each have a unique and charming design.\nEach sporting their own \"obsession\", these witches will make the fight a tough one for Shiroha, showing off their prowess with a full-screen animation.\nYou'll also unlock new sub-stories that reveal more about the lives of Shiori and other characters' pasts beyond the main story.\nPlease enjoy the world and its story, all presented with full Japanese voice acting.",
