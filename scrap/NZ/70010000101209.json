  "description": "Originally released in 2014, the legendary horror game DeathForest ~Escape from the Forest~ shook the internet and even spawned a live-action movie adaptation. Now, with completely overhauled graphics and further evolved terror, it makes its debut on Nintendo Switch™!\n\n【The \"Forest Tragedy\" Where Monstrosities Lurk】\n\n■ Synopsis\n\nIt was a humid summer twilight. It was supposed to be just an ordinary trip. A young man, Kazuki Uchida, steps into the dim forest as if lured by the darkness. However, he finds himself in a cursed place ruled by grotesque monstrosities.\n\nExperience the fear of being constantly chased by distinct, grotesque \"things.\" Evade them, hide in the shadows, and attempt to escape the forest.\n\nWill he be able to survive and escape this nightmare?\n\n■ Game Features\n\nThere are no \"Safe Zones\" in this game. From the very moment the game begins, that giant face, \"Yoshie,\" will chase you relentlessly.\n\nAdditionally, high-difficulty content has been implemented, including \"Double Speed Mode\" and \"Max Terror Mode.\"\n\n■ New Mode Added: \"Death Forest: ANOTHER\"\n\nIn the Mirror World, the terror of \"that face\" does not end with just one. It is a proliferation of nightmares, an evolution of despair.\n\nThe protagonist of this mode is Toka Hiiragi, a high school girl investigating local folklore. An original story unfolds from a perspective different from the main game, closing in on the mysteries hidden within \"that forest.\"\n\nFurthermore, this mode features \"Multi-Endings\" where your choices greatly alter your fate!\n\nWill she be able to escape the Mirror World alive?\n\n■ Recommended For:\n\nFans of first-person horror games.\n\nThose who aren't great with horror but still want a thrill.\n\nStreamers looking for a game that will hype up their audience.",
