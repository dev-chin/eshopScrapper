  "description": "The cult hit Use Your Words has all-new prompts and twice as many mini-games where you compete to write the funniest punchline – we set ‘em up, and you knock ‘em down! Players can use their phones or tablets as controllers, so it’s easy to jump in and seamless to play. And if you can’t think of a punchline, you can use one of our sneaky \"Decoy” answers to lay a trap for your opponents… all with beautiful new visuals by artist Andrew Kolb!\n\nCUSTOMIZE WITH “MIX N’ MATCH MODE”\nCreate your own custom playlist of mini-games in whatever order you choose! Want to binge your favorite mini-game 6 times in a row? Go for it!\n\nSPECTATOR MODE IS MORE FUN!\nYou can choose to play as a “spectator” and join an interactive meta-game that includes changing the main players’ scores, trivia questions, and even teasing players while they play! Use Your Words 2 supports up to 1,000 spectators who can play locally or remotely.\n\nOPTIMIZED FOR STREAMERS!\nUse Your Words 2 is great for streaming because your viewers can play along without having to buy a copy of the game! And if you activate our special “Streamer Mode”, the music will change to a royalty-free soundtrack that won’t get you demonetized, plus we’ll extend the timer to cancel out stream lag.\n\nMORE RESPONSIVE\nUse Your Words 2 pays attention to how you’re playing and laughs along with you… it can give you tips based on your party’s behavior and also congratulate (or dunk on) your party members as they play!\n\nMINI-GAMES\nUse Your Words 2 ships with 8 unique mini-games:\n\n• Sub The Title: It’s back! Write your own subtitle for a weird foreign film clip and make the actors say what you want them to say! It’s a blast for fans of funny video commentaries with a variety of wacky films from the past.\n\n• Book It!: We show you a weird blank book cover and you write the title (fans of Paperback Paradise should enjoy this one!)\n\n• Out of the Question: What if Jeopardy was funny? In our new lightning round, answer preposterous fake trivia questions with even more preposterous answers!\n\n• Letterheads: Come up with ridiculous product names for vintage magazine ads by filling out three predetermined product initials.\n\n• Blank-o-Matic: Fill in the blank to complete the sentence! Instead of waiting to have *the funniest card in your hand*, write an answer that matches your sense of humor!\n\n• Sign Me Up!: Vandalize various signs and surfaces with your own labels, scrawls, and smart*ssery!\n\n• Extra, Extra!: Write your own caption or clickbait headline for a ridiculous photo, in a take on the classic \"caption this\" game!\n\n• Survey Says: Go with your gut in this rapid-fire lightning round. Its classic game show vibe allows players to settle their “Feud” once and for all!\n\nWhether you're a total noob or a world-famous comedian, we guarantee hours of non-stop hilarity. So, grab a few friends and get ready to laugh along with Use Your Words 2!\n\nNote: This game is played locally, but remote players can play via stream or video conference.",
