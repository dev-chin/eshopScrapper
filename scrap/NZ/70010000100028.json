  "description": "- This game can only be played on the Nintendo Switch™ 2. It is not compatible with the Nintendo Switch™.\n\nDRAGON QUEST I & II HD-2D Remake is a stunning reimagining of the first two legendary adventures in the Erdrick trilogy, brought together in one package.\n\n(Players can play either DRAGON QUEST I or II whenever they want by selecting their preferred title on the game's start screen.)\n\nDRAGON QUEST I Story:\nThanks to the heroic efforts of the legendary Erdrick, the Lord of the Underworld was defeated and peace returned to the land of Alefgard. Yet this peace was not to last, as the diabolical Dragonlord has risen and unleashed hordes of monsters on the realm once more. Now, descendant of Erdrick, it is your destiny to defeat this new evil and rescue the world from its plight!\n\nThe Setting:\nThis tale takes place in the land of Alefgard, a realm given shape by a goddess known as Rubiss. The hero travels the land hoping to slay the mighty Dragonlord once and for all. Along the way he meets plenty of charming characters and faces numerous fearsome foes.\n\nDRAGON QUEST II Story:\nMany years have passed since Alefgard was saved at the hero's hand, earning him the same title as his storied forebear. The descendants of this Erdrick and his scions founded three kingdoms that thrived in peacetime. Yet, darkness stirs once more and a sudden invasion of malicious monsters plunges the world into shadow again. All that stands between the forces of evil and their wicked ambitions is a band of young princes and princesses of Erdrick's lineage. The time has come for them to venture forth and honor their ancestor's legacy!\n\nThe Setting:\nExplore a world filled with locales visited by the legendary hero as well as a host of new towns, castles, caves, and dungeons.\nAs the story progresses, you'll obtain a ship, which will allow you to traverse the seas and rivers, and broaden your horizons ever further.\n\nThe Party:\nThe Prince of Midenhall, the game's protagonist, is joined on his quest by his cousins the Prince of Cannock, the Princess of Moonbrooke and, entirely new to this version of the game, the Princess of Cannock. These four descendants of the legendary hero, Erdrick, band together to protect the world from evil forces.\n\nTurn-based Battles:\nEnjoy the traditional turn-based battles the series is known for. Attack with an assembly of weapons and let loose all kinds of spells and abilities to slay the many menacing monsters.",
