  "description": "Konpaku Youmu sets out to prove herself to Saigyouji Yuyuko, mistress of Hakugyokurou. Make use of her three skills and challenge the veteran incident resolver and shrine maiden, Hakurei Reimu. An exhilarating 3D bullet hell action game set in Gensokyo, the world of Touhou Project!\n\nThis game is a Touhou Project fangame.\n\n●About This Game\n\nKonpaku Youmu works as the gardener, security, and swordsmanship instructor for Saigyouji Yuyuko, mistress of Hakugyokurou.\n\nOne day, upon Youmu scolding her mistress for slacking off in her training, Yuyuko told her \"with your lack of skill, there won't be any training.\"\nYuyuko then challenged her to prove herself by defeating the shrine maiden who'd resolved Gensokyo's incidents time and time again:\nShe was to go and defeat Hakurei Reimu.\n\nYoumu wasn't happy with this, but showing awareness of her inexperience, she accepted her mistress's conditions and set off for Gensokyo.\nWill she be able to overcome the dangers awaiting her, defeat Reimu, and prove her skills to Yuyuko?\n\n●Gameplay\n\n・Use Three Skills to Clear Stages and Beat Bosses!\nYoumu has three skills that each have their own strong points – movement, area damage, and range, as well as high-damage Spell Card. They'll come in handy when clearing stages if used well!\n\nFor example, your dash skill can help extend your jump range as well as do damage, and your ranged skill can defeat troublesome foes waiting on the other side of gaps.\n\n・Each Skill Has its Own Button!\nPreviously, you toggle between between Youmu's three skills as you fought, but the skill controls have been updated to be more intuitive.\n\n・Farm Combos to Turn the Tides\nContinuing to hit enemies will raise your combo counter, granting bonuses to your score and skill recharge rate.\n\nThe latter bonus lets you use your skills much more often, making battles much easier.\n\n・Difficulty Options\nPlay on Easy, Hard, or Normal; whichever suits your skill level.\n\n・Music\nTouhou: Blossom Blade features Touhou arranges from Shoichiro Sakamoto, AKA Sound Sepher, to make stages feel even more alive.\n\n・Other Changes\nBalance changes\nMore breakable objects\nHUD additions\nNo more fall penalty\nGraphics optimized for modern hardware\nAdded English localization\n\nPlease enjoy the newly refined and more accessible Touhou: Blossom Blade on Nintendo Switch™!",
