  "description": "Only the faint crackling of firewood fills the night. A quiet, low-poly world, where each player's voice blends with the flickering of the campfire—that's \"Chillin' by the Fire\", the campfire simulation game.\n\n◆Growing fire, a new kind of gaming experience\nThe star of this game is the tiny flame born from your fingertips. The flow of the air, the thickness of the wood, and the angle at which it's placed all intertwine, as the flame steadily grows. Your goal: Campfire Level 10. The sense of accomplishment you feel when the firebed turns into bright red embers and the pillars of flame illuminate the night sky is more powerful than any scoreboard.\n\n◆Communication around the campfire\nWith an external camera connected, you can video chat with CameraPlay. You and your friends' real faces will show up around the campfire. As the light of the flames reflect off your expressions, you'll feel the same warmth even with players who are far away—a mysterious sense of closeness. Campfire Convo prompts will be displayed randomly, helping to spark some small talk. From every day chit-chat to late-night philosophy, the conversations are sure to get exciting.\n\n◆Beauty in simplicity—blazing orange gradients in HDR\nThe visuals are intentionally low-poly. Even so, the flames appear in a beautiful orange gradation thanks to HDR support. An eye-catching vividness and a deep, soothing sensation—savor them both.\n\n◆Subtle details that support healing and immersion\nTry headphones to fully experience the crackling of the flames and the sound of crumbling firewood. HD Rumble brings the feel of the campfire to your hands, uniting your sense of sight, sound, and touch.\n\n◆Anytime, anywhere\nWhether online or via GameShare, up to four players can gather around the same fire. The game supports GameShare, so even if only one person owns the game, everyone can play together. You can also share the experience via local multiplayer on Nintendo Switch™. Whether you're spending a quiet night alone or catching up with faraway friends, bring a gentle warmth into your everyday life.\n\n◆3 game modes\nNormal - Grow your fire and try to reach Campfire Level 10.\nSurvival - Your supply of firewood is limited. Plan how to pass the flame from one log to the next and prevent the fire from going out.\nPlayground - Use the four fire pits and play online to compete with friends. Whether racing to build the biggest fire, interfering with each other, or working together, it all depends on the rules you decide.\n\n◆Environmental changes through 4 stages\nBeach - High temperatures and low humidity, enjoy the most carefree campfire.\nGrove - A dry forest that offers a bit more challenge. Great for conversations with friends and just the right level of difficulty.\nPlateau - Majestic mountains stretch out in the distance. The temperature is lower and sometimes showers roll through. A location where even experienced players will find a challenge.\nSnow Mountain - Temperatures below freezing. A frigid area where both firewood and fireblower freeze over. A harsh environment that will put everything to the test.\n\nCampfires. Humanity's oldest social network.\nIn a world that’s always rushing, reclaim the simple joy of just watching a fire.",
