  "description": "It was all going so well.\n\nOne day the world’s experiencing a golden age of technology, the next it’s forcibly merged with an alternate dimension. It happens.\n\nNow there’s a new reality, a world between worlds: The Bast.\n\nRemnants of the Rift is a roguelite tactics game where you can pause, plan, and play. You are Morgan, dimension-diving merc, delving deeper and deeper into The Bast at the request of the factions looking to exploit this new reality.\n\nBut you’re going to need help to survive in the depths. Help, and a whole lot of skill.\n\nPlan, Play, Pause\nRemnants of the Rift combines the tactics of grid-based strategy with the thrills of an action game. Each level plays out in real-time, but you can pause the game to assess the battlefield, prep your attacks and plan your next move. Use mods and equipment to enhance your preferred style of play and overcome your interdimensional foes.\n\nOutlast the Bast\nEvery dive is different: change your strategies on the fly to counter a dimension in flux. Study each of the procedurally-generated battles and adapt to by customizing your playstyle to defeat all enemies and reap the bountiful rewards. But don’t worry, death isn’t the end. So head home, re-equip, and dive back in.\n\nWith a Little Help From Friends\nYou’re not alone on your journey into The Bast. As a mercenary, you’ll deal with close associates and vying factions: everyone wants a piece of this new reality. But going deeper means getting better, and you’ll have to create unlikely alliances to procure the equipment you need to explore further.\n\nIt’s time to dive back in, Mercenary\n",
