  "description": "About FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly REMAKE\nThe full remake of the second installment in the FATAL FRAME (PROJECT ZERO) series titled FATAL FRAME / PROJECT ZERO II: Crimson Butterfly. This Japanese-style horror adventure game follows twin sisters who become lost in an abandoned village haunted by vengeful spirits. Using the Camera Obscura—a device that can capture and seal away the impossible—they fight ghosts as the story unfolds.\nThis title has undergone a complete overhaul, with improvements to everything from visuals and audio to the core gameplay systems and controls. The signature Camera Obscura mechanic, used to capture and fend off spirits, remains a key feature, now offering richer and more engaging gameplay in both exploration and combat. In addition, the new \"Holding Hands with Mayu\" mechanic adds a heartfelt touch, letting you experience the deep bond between the sisters like never before.\n\nFATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly Beautifully Remade\nThe graphics, sound, and controls have all been rebuilt from the ground up. Character textures, including skin and clothing, have been refined to the highest detail, and Minakami Village has been meticulously recreated with a focus on light and shadow, bringing its dark and ominous atmosphere to life with stunning realism.\nWith 3D sound, you can feel the presence of spirits more vividly and closely. Immerse yourself in the chilling experience of exploring a haunted village.\nSide stories and new areas have been added, offering players a deeper and more immersive experience in the world of FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly.\n\nEnhanced Camera Obscura Battles\nThe iconic gameplay of repelling spirits using the Camera Obscura remains intact, while introducing new features such as Focus, Zoom, and Filter Switching.\nFilters offer unique functionalities for both combat and exploration, allowing players to adapt to attacking spirits and uncover the mysteries of the cursed village.\n\nA Digital Deluxe edition of FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly REMAKE is also available. Please be careful to avoid duplicate purchases.\n\nFor more information, visit the official website: https://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/zero/crimson-re/uk/",
