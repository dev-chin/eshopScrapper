  "description": "The Perfect Pencil is a surreal action platformer which tells the tale of personal development and the psychology of fear. Join protagonist John as he awakens in a bizarre hand-drawn kingdom and comes face-to-face with the terrors that dwell in the last place he'd have thought to look...\n\nEmbark on an emotional odyssey exploring the depths of an unfamiliar environment using protagonist John's innate ability to see things that others can’t. Make choices that will compel you to carve your own personal route through both light and darkness, however, beware, things might not be as they seem.\n\nGo off the beaten path and discover numerous side quests dotted throughout the world, you never know what you might find. Both dark and comforting surreal landscapes filled with secrets, surprises and peculiar personalities are waiting to be unraveled.\n\nJohn’s unique analysis ability grants you the power to uncover hidden information about NPCs, peculiar objects and elements of the environment. The Perfect Pencil is filled with additional lore and secrets for players to find. Roam beyond the beaten path, scan the world around you - Who knows... behind one of these corners you might find something that will change your perspective.\n\nJohn draws his strength from within, but he will also encounter tense boss battles in the form of unsettling manifestations - all symbolising unique elements of the human psyche. Some encounters may even make you question your sense of reality…but remember, in order to survive you will have to be willing to take risks.\n\n",
